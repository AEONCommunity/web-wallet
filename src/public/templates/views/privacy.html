            Please read through our Privacy Policy carefully.<br/>
            <br/>
            <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
            This Privacy Policy explains how information about you is collected, used and disclosed by AEON Pocket ("we"
            or "us"). This Privacy Policy (together with our Terms of Service and any other documents referred to therein
            or herein) applies to information we collect when you use our websites, mobile applications, hosted AEON
            accounts and other online products and services (collectively, the "Services") or when you otherwise interact
            with us.<br/>
            We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the
            date at the top of the policy and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice such as by adding
            a statement to on our blog or by sending you an email notification. We encourage you to review the Privacy
            Policy whenever you access the Services to stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can
            help protect your privacy.<br/>

            <h3>2. Collection of Information</h3>
            Information You Provide to Us - We collect information you provide directly to us. For example, we collect
            information when you create an account, participate in any interactive features of the Services, fill out a
            form, complete a AEON transaction via the Services, request customer support or otherwise communicate with us.
            The types of information we may collect include your email address, AEON address, OpenAlias aliases, password,
            mobile phone number, mobile PIN code and any other information you choose to provide.<br/>
            Information We Collect Automatically When You Use the Services - When you access or use our Services, we
            automatically collect information about you, including:<br/>
            Log Information: We may log information about your use of the Services, including the type of browser you use,
            access times, pages viewed, your IP address and the page you visited before navigating to our websites.<br/>
            Device Information: We may collect information about the mobile device you use to access our mobile application,
            including the hardware model, operating system and version, unique device identifiers and mobile network information.<br/>

            see which areas and features of our Services are popular and count visits. Please note that disabling cookies
            will break the session functionality that is required by the hosted AEON account service.<br/>
            Account Address Information: When you create an account through our Services, a view key is automatically
            generated and sent to server when required. We do not ever store or know your private spend key, which means
            that it is cryptographically impossible for us to spend funds on your behalf.<br/>
            Information We Collect From Other Sources: We may also obtain information from other sources and combine that
            with information we collect through our Services. For instance, as and when we implement a live chat support
            system we may collect information provided by you during the use of this system, such as your name and email
            address. We may also use third-party services branded as AEON. Any third-party services may collect information
